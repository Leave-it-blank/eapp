## Customization

To customize the appearance of the eWaste Web App and incorporate the requested lime green color, you can modify the styles using Tailwind CSS.

 
Open the resources/css/app.css file.

Locate the Tailwind CSS section and update the color classes with the desired lime green color values. For example:

 
```
.bg-lime {
  background-color: #00ff00; /* Your lime green color code */
}

.text-lime {
  color: #00ff00; /* Your lime green color code */
} 
``` 

Save the changes.
Rebuild the CSS file using Laravel Mix:
 
``npm install 
 npm run dev``
 
The application will now use the customized lime green color for specific elements throughout the interface.
